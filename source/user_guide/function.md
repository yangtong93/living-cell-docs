5. Scale bar
6. Scale units
7. Analysis of areas of interest
8. Analyze the current image

![](../_static/images/analysis_1.png)

1. Bandwidth: Detail retention. The smaller the l-value, the easier it is to preserve large objects (such as uniform plaque contamination in the image); The larger the right value, the easier it is to preserve small objects (such as random Gaussian noise generated by devices); Suggest selecting the middle value
2. Threshold: Signal threshold. The smaller the value, the easier it is to preserve image details, and vice versa.
3. Eccentricity: Eccentricity screening threshold. The smaller the value, the greater the filtering effect on long or irregular objects, and vice versa.
4. Minimum area: The minimum area of the retained mask. The smaller the value, the easier it is to retain small areas of cells (and also more likely to introduce noise), and vice versa.
5. Maximum Void: The maximum area of a closed void. The larger the value, the larger the closed cavity, and vice versa.
6. Similar to 2.
7. Domain block size: The dynamic segmentation block size of the domain. The smaller the neighborhood block, the easier it is to be sensitive to small objects and recognize local small objects.
8. Similar to 3.
9. Similar to 4.
10. Similar to 5.
11. Display the channel image
12. Brightness adjustment
13. Contrast adjustment
14. Reduce background to the left and increase brightness to the right
15. Pseudo color selection
16. Display and hide the mask of a certain channel
17. Adjust the color and width of the edge lines of the mask
18. Adjust the color and opacity of the filled area

#### Scratch analysis

![](../_static/images/analysis_4.png)


1. Smoothness: The smaller the size, the smaller the recognition area, and vice versa.
2. Boundary adhesion: The smaller the size, the larger the recognition area, and vice versa.
3. Display the channel image
4. Brightness adjustment
5. Contrast adjustment
6. Reduce background to the left and increase brightness to the right
